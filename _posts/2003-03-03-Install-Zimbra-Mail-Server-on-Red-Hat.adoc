:hp-tags: installation, server
:published_at: 2003-03-03

=== First thing to do..

* Download ZCS file from https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source/[this link]
* DNS Server installed with pointed mx record. (in this case, we'll install dns server in the same node with zimbra mail server)
* coffee maybe?


=== Second Step

After you downloaded the ZCS file, and just transfer it to your Zimbra Mail Server. +
if you using windows you can transfer with `WinSCP` or other ftp/scp client. +
But if you are using linux or mac, you can use a `scp` command.

=== Third Step - Initial Configuration
In this section, we'll configure on the networking side, like ip address, hostname, etc. +
> *IP Address*
[source,bash]
[root@zimbra ~]# nmtui
